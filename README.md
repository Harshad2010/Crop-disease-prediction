# Crop-disease-prediction (Cotton Plant)

## Problem Statement.
I developed “Cotton Plant Disease Prediction” using Artificial Intelligence especially Deep learning. Knowing Farmer, I know Farmer can’t solve Farm’s complex and even small problems due to lack of perfect education. So as AI enthusiastic I decided to solve this problem using the latest technology like AI.

## Introduction:
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for accurately predicting the type of disease affecting a cotton plant. The model is trained on a dataset comprising of images of healthy plant/leaf as well as disseased plant/leaf. 

The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build a model that can identify the disease affecting the cotton plant with high accuracy.

## Data:
The dataset used in this project consists of images of cotton plants which are fresh and diseased. The dataset includes multiple categories such as 'diseased cotton leaf','diseased cotton plant','fresh cotton leaf','fresh cotton plant'. It consists of aprroximately 5000 images of fresh and 5000 images of diseased plant and diseased leaf.

## Model:
The model architecture used in this project involves a deep learning model based on CNNs. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is trained on the pre-processed images to classify the images as fresh and diseased. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function.

## Conclusion:
The model developed in this project is able to achieve high accuracy in predicting images from farms. The model was able to correctly identify the type of disease affecting the cotton plant with high accuracy.
